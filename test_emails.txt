1. Question

CUSTOMER
Subject: Question about Num pricing
Body: Hello, can you tell me what pricing plans are available for a fleet of 20 trucks?

AGENT
Subject: Re: Question about Num pricing
Body: 
Num currently offers five tiers:

• Free — for very small fleets
• Starter
• Growth
• Scale
• Pro

A 20-truck operation will most often fit into our Growth or Scale
plans, depending on how many dispatcher seats and advanced features
(e.g. multi-lane rate shopping, cross-broker bidding, dedicated SLA)
you need. To get exact pricing and see a side-by-side feature
breakdown, please schedule a quick demo with our team or reach out to
your Numeo sales rep.
